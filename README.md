# Projecting Youtube Videos on Web based Augmented Reality
<img alt="Screenshot" src="img/screenshot.jpg" width="600">

### **Description / Rationale**
This is a small project, which demonstrates one of the most popular requested features - the possibility of projecting Youtube videos on web based augmented reality powered by MindAR.js and AFrame. The project uses slightly modified version of <a href="https://github.com/ryota-mitarai/aframe-websurfaces">AFrame Websurfaces component created by Ryota Mitarai</a> in combination with world to local matrix transforms powered by Three.js/AFrame.  

### **Instructions**
To see the project at work just copy the repository to your local server and explore all the functionality. To change video, just insert Youtube embedded video url:
'''websurface="url:https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6iKapYgN94

Animations can be downloaded separately from <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/">mixamo.com</a>. 

<b>Please note</b>: Animations downloaded from Mixamo are in .fbx format. They need to be converted to binary GLTF (.glb) files using Blender. While doing so, make sure to: rename the animation; save the file with the same name as animation.   

### **Tech Stack**
The project is powered by AFrame and Three.js

### **Future Work**
- Adding more animations.
